<p align="left">Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm an enthusiast at heart, and my journey revolves around two constants: a love for mathematics and an insatiable appetite for technology. From algorithms to embedded systems, from robotics to trains, I'm on a perpetual quest to explore the vast expanse of our world, both on the ground and in the cosmos.<br><br>My coding mission is simple: to craft code that not only works seamlessly but also reads like a compelling story. I believe that learning and technology should be fun, and I'm here to make that a reality, the creation is part of my heart and will keep this way for the rest of my life. Whether we're improving our daily lives or breaking through inherited barriers, technology holds the key to incredible achievements, and I'm excited to be part of the journey.<br><br>As for the future, who knows what awaits? But I'm confident that together, we'll craft something revolutionary, a game-changer that reshapes our world. Until that day arrives, I'm hard at work on tech-infused projects that span the spectrum, from the cosmos to our home planet, from rockets to cars, and even delving into the wonders of biology!</p>

<h3 align="left">📡 What I'm doing</h3>
-Cubesat Araripe: This satellite, named Cubesat Araripe, serves as the central hub for comprehensive monitoring and control within our mission. It leverages various sensor inputs and interfaces, utilizing GPIO Ports for I2C communication with an ADS 1115 ADC, external sensors (SHT20, OPT3002, ENS160), battery temperature sensing, and UART communication with a WT931 Witmotion Gyroscope. Additionally, it manages a camera servo for precise angle adjustments, while USB interfaces handle 4G connectivity and a Sony IMX 298 AutoFocus USB Camera connection. Cubesat Araripe offers a versatile and robust solution for effectively monitoring and interfacing with a diverse array of sensors and peripherals, all within the compact confines of our satellite mission. Rust-powered design.
